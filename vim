Vim disadvantages:
- No way to search for bindings for a command (?)
- No normal mode (or anything similar) in Command-line mode, arrow keys, Home, End, and Del keys have to be used
- At least two different ways to denote keybindings: <C-w>q for mapping, CTRL-w_q for help
- No way of discovering shadowing mappings from help files
- No persistent help buffer (?)
- No mappings depending on type of buffer (?)
